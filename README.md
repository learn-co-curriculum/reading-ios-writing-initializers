# Writing Initializers

## Objectives

1. Recognize when initializers are useful, especially with read-only properties.
2. Identify the role of a designated initializer.
3. Compose a designated initializer.
4. Override the default initializer (`init`) to call a designated initializer.
5. Write convenience initializers that call a designated initializer.

## Initializer Methods

We've discussed the use cases of the `alloc` and `init` method pairs in the past, but what are these methods actually doing? The `alloc` method is a class method that *allocates* a place in memory (RAM) to hold the instance variables that comprise an object of the given class. The `init` method is what actually populates that portion of memory with the relevant structure. Other initializers can be written which actually populate the structure with information (values) right from the start.

We can compare these two roles to the phases of constructing a building: the `alloc` method is like selecting the ground that will be the building's lot, designating and preparing the place for it to go. The `init` method, however, is the phase of actually building the structure that's detailed in the architect's blueprint.

The `init` method is actually just the basic initializer, called the "default initializer". In general, though, an initializer is any method that returns an `instancetype` and the compiler will require that the method name begins with `init...`. Methods from the `init` family can be set up to offer varying levels of pre-fabricated setup. 

These "convenience initializers" and "designated initializers" can be seen like asking the construction firm to paint the house something other than white, or even to find an interior designer to provide furniture and to hang art on the walls. In such a case, the house is further along to becoming an actual home instead of just an empty free-standing structure that serves as the most basic form of a house.

#### Initializing Read-Only Values

Initializers are necessary for setting up read-only properties that cannot be written to from outside the class, such as in the case of creating an instance of `NSSortDescriptor`:

```objc
// incorrect: assigning to read-only properties

NSSortDescriptor *sortByNameAsc = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] init];
sortByNameAsc.key = @"name";
sortByNameAsc.ascending = YES;
```

![](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/ios-intro-to-objects-unit/readonly_error.png)

The initializer allows a user of that class to provide an initial value for those read-only properties upon creating an instance:

```objc
// correct: using an initializer to give the properties initial values

NSSortDescriptor *sortByNameAsc = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@"name"
                                                              ascending:YES];
```

![](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/ios-intro-to-objects-unit/readonly_init.png)

Providing an initializer allows the class to ensure that instances have the information they need to behave appropriately from their creation. It also allows us, the developer, to document requirements for setting up instances of a class we create.

### The Designated Initializer

A "designated initializer" is the initializer method which provides the *most thorough coverage of that class's data.* It doesn't necessarily provide *complete* coverage, just the *most* coverage of any of the `init...` methods. The designated initializer should return an instance of the given class that's considered prepared enough for actual use.

Take for example, the `initWithObjects:count:` method available to `NSArray`. You probably have not seen this method written anywhere because the `initWithObjects:` method and the array literal syntax (`@[]`) both handle the `count:` argument implicitly, but yet, this value is necessary to its operation. The `initWithObjects:count:` method is a designated initializer that takes in a C-array of objects and an integer noting the "count" of those objects. To use it directly, some scary-looking C syntax has to be used:

```objc
// scary C-language syntax

NSArray *instructors = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:(const id[5]){ @"Joe", @"Tim", @"Tom", @"Jim", @"Mark" } count:5];
    
NSLog(@"%@", instructors);
```
This will print:

```
(
    Joe,
    Tim,
    Tom,
    Jim,
    Mark
)
```

Because of the way `NSArray`s are structured on top of the C-language, this designated initializer *must* be called at some point in every process of initializing an instance of the `NSArray` class. However, the `initWithObjects:` method is provided to increase the abstraction away from the C-language and simply take a list of objects to be added to the array. Internally to this *convenience initializer*, the list of objects is translated into the C-array and a `count` integer that are passed into the designated initializer as arguments on our behalf:

```objc
// convenience initializer

NSArray *instructors = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"Joe", @"Tim", @"Tom", @"Jim", @"Mark", nil];

NSLog(@"%@", instructors);
```
This will print:

```
(
    Joe,
    Tim,
    Tom,
    Jim,
    Mark
)
```
However, we still have to remember to end the list with `nil` (**Advanced:** *This use of* `nil` *simply tells the method when to stop looking for more objects in the list.*). The array literal syntax *further* abstracts the use of the designated initializer by removing the need to end the list with `nil`, or even to make a method call at all:

```objc
// array literal

NSArray *instructors = @[ @"Joe", @"Tim", @"Tom", @"Jim", @"Mark" ];

NSLog(@"%@", instructors);
```
This will also print:

```
(
    Joe,
    Tim,
    Tom,
    Jim,
    Mark
)
```
But *internally*, all of these initialization routes *must* pass through a designated initializer at some point; other initializers that are not defined as designated initializers *must* pass through a designated initializer. This is a way that the compiler helps to ensure that the instance will be functional at run time.

**Note:** *While this is not strictly enforced by Objective-C itself, it is considered best practice—especially when writing Objective-C that will interface with anything written Swift which does hold strict rules about designated initializers.*

### Declaring the Designated Initializer

Like other public methods, initializers need to be declared in the `.h` header file. The rules for `init` family methods that are enforced by Apple via the compiler are that it:

  * must be an instance method (`-`),
  * must return an `instancetype`, and
  * must begin with the word `init`.

```objc
- (instancetype)init...;
```
When writing any initializer that is not the default initializer `init`, it is common practice to continue the method name with the word `With` followed by an argument for every property into which the initializer is expected to pass a value. As convention, the arguments in the method declaration are typically named after the property to which it is intended to be assigned.

So, assuming a custom class `FISWarship`:

```objc
// FISWarship.h

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface FISWarship : NSObject

@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *shipName;
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger currentSpeedInKnots;
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger maximumSpeedInKnots;

@end
```

The designated initializer for a `FISWarship` class might be declared as:

```objc
- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName
             currentSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)currentSpeedInKnots
             maximumSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)maximumSpeedInKnots;
```

### Defining the Designated Initializer

#### Autocomplete in Xcode

Because designated initializers can feel particularly verbose at times, relying on autocomplete to reference the declared method elsewhere your in code is good practice to both save keystrokes and to defend against typos.

In the `.m` implementation file for the class, utilize autocomplete by typing the instance method indicator (`-`) followed by the first few letters of the method name. In the case of non-default initializers this will be `initWith...`. Select the appropriate method if there is more than one option and open the curly braces `{` `}` that contain the implementation code.

```objc
// FISWarship.m

#import "FISWarship.h"

@implementation FISWarship

- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName 
             currentSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)currentSpeedInKnots
             maximumSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)maximumSpeedInKnots {

}

@end
```

#### Implementation Syntax

Now within the implementation of the designated initializer, we want to follow this code structure:

```objc
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        /**
        * Set instance variables to their 
        * associated method arguments.
        */
    }
    return self;
}
```
This first line `self = [super init]` captures into the `self` keyword a default initialization of an instance of the current class's "super class" (or "parent class")—the class from which the current class inherits. Inheritance will be discussed in a later topic. For now, understand that **only a designated initializer should call the superclass.**

The `if (self) {...}` statement protects against cases in which the initializer being deferred to (called by `[super init]`) might return `nil`. This might happen if the other initializer receives a bad input, such as `NSURL`'s `initWithString:` method if the string argument isn't a properly formatted URL.

Within the `if (self) {...}` statement, each instance variable is set to the associated argument that was passed into the method call:

```objc
        //    ivar        argument
        _propertyName = propertyName;
```

The `return self` line satisfies the `instancetype` return of the initializer method since it returns the newly created instance of the class.

So, the implementation for the designated initializer on the `FISWarship` class should look like this:

```objc
// FISWarship.m

#import "FISWarship.h"

@implementation FISWarship

- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName
             currentSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)currentSpeedInKnots
             maximumSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)maximumSpeedInKnots {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        _shipName = shipName;
        _currentSpeedInKnots = currentSpeedInKnots;
        _maximumSpeedInKnots = maximumSpeedInKnots;
    }
    return self;
}

@end
```

### Calling the Designated Initializer

Now from elsewhere in our code we can use the designated initializer to return an instance of our class that's already set up:

```objc
FISWarship *ussMissouri = [[FISWarship alloc] initWithShipName:@"USS Missouri"
                                           currentSpeedInKnots:0
                                           maximumSpeedInKnots:33];
    
NSLog(@"Ship's Name: %@", ussMissouri.shipName);
NSLog(@"Current Speed: %lu", ussMissouri.currentSpeedInKnots);
NSLog(@"Maximum Speed: %lu", ussMissouri.maximumSpeedInKnots);
```
This will print:

```
Ship's Name: USS Missouri
Current Speed: 0
Maximum Speed: 33
```

## Overriding the Default Initializer `init`

Every class in Objective-C has a public default initializer method (`init`) that can be overridden. The purpose of doing so is to make sure that any time an instance of that class is created with that default initializer that an appropriate designated initializer is called.

**Advanced:** *The* `init` *method is inherited from* `NSObject` *which is the highest class in the inheritance tree. Inheritance will be discussed in the next unit.*

### Declaring the Default Initializer

Because the default initializer is already publicly available, it's actually not *necessary* to publicly declare the default initializer in the `.h` header file when overriding it. However, it is considered best practice to do so as a sign to other developers that default initializer *has* been overridden, and it's best to organize it as the first method listed in the initializer group. In the context of our `FISWarship` class, this would look like this:

```objc
// FISWarship.h

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface FISWarship : NSObject

@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *shipName;
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger currentSpeedInKnots;
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger maximumSpeedInKnots;

- (instancetype)init;

- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName
             currentSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)currentSpeedInKnots
             maximumSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)maximumSpeedInKnots;

@end
```

### Defining the Default Initializer

When implementing an override of the default initializer, it's best to have it call a designated initializer that was set up otherwise, providing arguments to set properties to *default* values. 

```objc
// default initializer override syntax

- (instancetype)init {
    self = [self initWith...];
    return self;
}
```

Because the designated initializer is a method on the current class, we use the `self` keyword as the recipient of the designated initializer method call and ***not*** the `super` keyword. (*Remember, the designated initializer is already set up to call* `[super init]`.) We can then capture the return of the designated initializer method into the `self` keyword and then return `self`.
The implementation of overriding the default initializer on our `FISWarship` class might look this:

```objc
// FISWarship.m

- (instancetype)init {
    self = [self initWithShipName:@""
              currentSpeedInKnots:0
              maximumSpeedInKnots:0];
    return self;
}
```
This makes sure that none of these properties are initialized to `nil` when a user of the `FISWarship` class calls the default initializer. This can help with debugging when testing since, for example, a string property that holds an empty string is much easier to troubleshoot than a string property that holds `nil`.

**Note:** *This is particularly useful for mutable collection properties such as* `NSMutableArray` *and* `NSMutableDictionary` *to ensure that they are set up to receive method calls to add or remove objects.*

We could also define the default initializer to set up an instance populated with non-zero information:

```objc
// FISWarship.m

- (instancetype)init {
    self = [self initWithShipName:@"Mary Celeste"
              currentSpeedInKnots:0
              maximumSpeedInKnots:20];
    return self;
}
```
This will cause every instance of our `FISWarship` class created with the default initializer to be returned with the `shipName` set to `Mary Celeste` and the `maximumSpeedInKnots` property set to `20`:

```objc
FISWarship *ship = [[FISWarship alloc] init];
FISWarship *boat = [[FISWarship alloc] init];

NSLog(@"%@ - Max: %lu", ship.shipName, ship.maximumSpeedInKnots);
NSLog(@"%@ - Max: %lu", boat.shipName, boat.maximumSpeedInKnots);
```
This will print:

```
Mary Celeste - Max: 20
Mary Celeste - Max: 20
```

## Convenience Initializers

In between the designated initializers (which provides the *most* coverage) and the default initializer (which provides *basic* coverage) exists the realm of "convenience initializers". Convenience initializers are, well, written for convenience. They provide an interface to the user of the class to set up an instance of it with *some*, but not *all*, of its potential options as customizable.

Take, for example, `NSSortDescriptor`'s `initWithKey:ascending:` method. Apple's Documentation on this method explains that it initializes the instance with the default comparison selector (`compare:`). We can infer that it's internally calling the `initWithKey:ascending:selector:` initializer, handing off the two arguments for `key` and `ascending`, and passing in `@selector(compare:)` into the `selector` argument:

```objc
// inferred implementation in NSSortDescriptor.m

- (instancetype)initWithKey:(NSString *)keyPath 
                  ascending:(BOOL)ascending {
                  
    self = [self initWithKey:keyPath                // passes in the keyPath argument
                   ascending:ascending              // passes in the ascending argument
                    selector:@selector(compare:)];  // passes in a default value for the selector property
    return self;
}
```
By doing this, the writer of the `NSSortDescriptor` class has provided a means of creating a useful instance of that class without requiring knowledge or understanding of the `@selector(compare:)` argument that's necessary for the instance to operate. Convenience initializers, in a way, are like training wheels on a bicycle; they permit a limited and *safe* use of an object's full power to someone who isn't fully proficient at using it in its true complexity.

### Writing a Convenience Initializer

Composing a convenience initializer is similar to overriding a default initializer: it should assign to `self` a call on `self` of a designated initializer OR another more complex convenience initializer which leads to a designated initializer.

In the case of our `FISWarship` class, we can create a convenience initializer that allows the user to submit values only for the `shipName` property or the `maximumSpeedInKnots` property: 

```objc
// FISWarship.h

- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName
             maximumSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)maximumSpeedInKnots;
```

```objc
// FISWarship.m

- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName
             maximumSpeedInKnots:(NSUInteger)maximumSpeedInKnots {
    
    self = [self initWithShipName:shipName               // passes in the shipName argument
              currentSpeedInKnots:0                      // passes in a default value for the property
              maximumSpeedInKnots:maximumSpeedInKnots];  // passes in the maximumSpeedInKnots argument
    return self;
}
```

We can also create an even simpler convenience initializer that allows the user to submit a value only for the `shipName` property. In order to avoid repeating our default value that we set up in `initWithShipName:maximumSpeedInKnots:`, we can actually call *that* initializer within our new `initWithShipName:` convenience initializer.

```objc
// FISWarship.h

- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName;
```

```objc
// FISWarship.m

- (instancetype)initWithShipName:(NSString *)shipName {
    
    self = [self initWithShipName:shipName  // passes in the shipName argument
              maximumSpeedInKnots:20];      // passes in a default value for the property
    return self;
}
```
This allows us to adhere to the DRY ("don't repeat yourself") mantra.

From outside the class, a user can call these convenience initializers and receive a functional instance while only providing partial information:

```objc
FISWarship *ussNewJersey = [[FISWarship alloc] initWithShipName:@"USS New Jersey"];
FISWarship *ussWisconsin = [[FISWarship alloc] initWithShipName:@"USS Wisconsin"
                                            maximumSpeedInKnots:33];
    
NSLog(@"%@ - Speed: %lu - Max: %lu", ussNewJersey.shipName, ussNewJersey.currentSpeedInKnots, ussNewJersey.maximumSpeedInKnots);
NSLog(@"%@ - Speed: %lu - Max: %lu", ussWisconsin.shipName, ussWisconsin.currentSpeedInKnots, ussWisconsin.maximumSpeedInKnots);
``` 
This will print:

```
USS New Jersey - Speed: 0 - Max: 20
USS Wisconsin - Speed: 0 - Max: 33
```
